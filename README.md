WLC based dsDNA persistence length calculater

Matlab code for calculating persistence length of dsDNA in D-shaped DNA according to single-molecule FRET efficiency measruement (version R2017b).
The WLC model: dsDNA portion bending / FJC model: ssDNA string.
Basic information of D-shaped DNA is well illuministrated in the article as follows,
